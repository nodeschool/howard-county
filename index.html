<p>We're a meetup group that helps people (especially high school students) new to JavaScript, Node.js, or programming in general get comfortable with self directed lessons. Our meetups are group learning experiences, where people of all skill levels come together to strengthen their understanding of JavaScript.</p>

<p>As part of our effort to ensure that everyone feels safe and welcome at our events, we ask that all participants follow our Code of Conduct.</p>

<h3>
<a id="code-of-conduct" class="anchor" href="#code-of-conduct" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code of Conduct</h3>

<p>We, the organizers of NodeSchool Howard County, are dedicated to providing a
harassment-free community for everyone, regardless of sex, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, age, body
size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs. We do not tolerate harassment of
community members in any form. Participants violating these rules may be
sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the organizers
of NodeSchool Howard County.</p>

<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal or written comments related to sex, gender
identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
age, body size, race, nationality, or religious beliefs, deliberate
intimidation, threats, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate
for any events at NodeSchool Howard County meetups or in any related
communication channels. Community members asked to stop any harassing behavior
are expected to comply immediately. Sponsors and presenters are also subject to
the anti-harassment policy.</p>

<p>If a community member engages in harassing behavior, the organizers of
NodeSchool Howard County may take any action they deem appropriate, including
warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being
harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any concerns,
please contact an organizer immediately.</p>
